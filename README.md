# IKDU-GitTry
## IKDU Homework
This repository is made to contain my first try properly using GitHub

Furthermore the project contains my homework for IKDU.
It is the intention that you only move a set increment per press, since I have already made more smoothly moving project earlier.
### Further Development:
- Making proper "death" when you touch the walls
